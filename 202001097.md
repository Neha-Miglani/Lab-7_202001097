# P4 
- The following problem has been adapted from The Art of Software Testing, by G. Myers (1979). The
function triangle takes three integer parameters that are interpreted as the lengths of the sides of a
triangle. It returns whether the triangle is equilateral (three lengths equal), isosceles (two lengths equal),
scalene (no lengths equal), or invalid (impossible lengths).

<pre>

public class lab7_4 {
	final int EQUILATERAL = 0;
	final int ISOSCELES = 1;
	final int SCALENE = 2;
	final int INVALID = 3;
	public  int triangle(int a, int b, int c)
	{
	if (a >= b+c || b >= a+c || c >= a+b)
		return(INVALID);
	if (a == b && b == c)
		return(EQUILATERAL);
	if (a == b || a == c || b == c)
		return(ISOSCELES);
		return(SCALENE);

	}
}

</pre>

* Test cases

1. a = 3; b=3; c = 3; expected = 0 (equilateral)

# P5 
- The function prefix (String s1, String s2) returns whether or not the string s1 is a prefix
of string s2 (you may assume that neither s1 nor s2 is null).

	public static boolean prefix(String s1, String s2)
	{
	if (s1.length() > s2.length())
	{
	return false;
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++)
	{
	if (s1.charAt(i) != s2.charAt(i))
	{
	return false;
	}
	}
	return true;

# P6 
- Consider again the triangle classification program (P4) with a slightly different specification: The program
reads floating values from the standard input. The three values A, B, and C are interpreted as
representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The program then prints a message to the standard output
that states whether the triangle, if it can be formed, is scalene, isosceles, equilateral, or right angled.
Determine the following for the above program:

a) Identify the equivalence classes for the system

b) Identify test cases to cover the identified equivalence classes. Also, explicitly mention which test case would cover which equivalence class.
(Hint: you must need to be ensure that the identified set of test cases cover all identified equivalence classes)

c) For the boundary condition A + B > C case (scalene triangle), identify test cases to verify the boundary.

d) For the boundary condition A = C case (isosceles triangle), identify test cases to verify the boundary.

e) For the boundary condition A = B = C case (equilateral triangle), identify test cases to verify the boundary.

f) For the boundary condition A2 + B2 = C2 case (right-angle triangle), identify test cases to verify the boundary.

g) For the non-triangle case, identify test cases to explore the boundary.

h) For non-positive input, identify test points.



# SECTION B

1. Control Flow Graph

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123479469/231516744-1ec1e4b7-e4ed-42f6-8908-33a2906b55a6.png)

2. Construct test sets for your flow graph that are adequate for the following criteria:
a. Statement Coverage.
b. Branch Coverage.
c. Basic Condition Coverage.

a) Statement coverage test sets: To achieve statement coverage, we need to make sure that every statement in the code is executed at least once.

* Test cases 
1. p is an empty vector
2. p is a vector with one point
3. p is a vector with two points having same y component
4. p is a vector with two points having different y components
5. p is a vector with three or more different points with different points with same y components
6. p is a vector with three or more different points with different points with different y components

b) Branch coverage test sets: To achieve branch coverage, we need to make sure that every possible branch in the code is taken at least once.

* Test cases
1. p is an empty vector
2. p is a vector with one point
3. p is a vector with two points having same y component
4. p is a vector with two points having different y components
5. p is a vector with three or more different points with different points with same y components and with same x components.
6. p is a vector with three or more different points with different points with different y components and with same x components.
7. p is a vector with three or more points with the same x and y components

c) Basic condition coverage test sets: To achieve basic condition coverage, we need to make sure that every basic condition in the code is evaluated as both true and false at least once

* Test cases
1. p is an empty vector
2. p is a vector with one point
3. p is a vector with two points having same y component
4. p is a vector with two points having different y components
5. p is a vector with three or more different points with different points with same y components and with same x components.
6. p is a vector with three or more different points with different points with different y components and with same x components.
7. p is a vector with three or more points with the same x and y components
8. p is a vector with some of them having same x component and all of them having same y component

* Test cases examples: 
1) p=[(x=2,y=3),(x=2,y=2),(x=1,y=5),(x=1,y=4)]
2) p=[(x=5,y=6),(x=3,y=2),(x=3,y=4),(x=1,y=2)]
3) p=[(x=5,y=6),(x=3,y=5),(x=1,y=5),(x=4,y=5),(x=2,y=7)]
4) p=[(x=7,y=8)]
5) p=[]

These 5 test cases covers all - statement coverage, branch coverage and basic condition coverage.
